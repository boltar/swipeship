Use MainMenu.java as temporary sandbox

Code the logic in button listeners in MainMenu.java (and ditch MainMenuScreen.java, or rename)

Why does the game not resume after hitting 'play' in menu?
Probably because something isn't being set up right when we switch screens
MainMenu -> GameScreen

setInputProcessor isn't being called on screen switches... is this a problem?
