Move all game logic from GameScreen.java to SwipeShipMain.java
need to separate MainMenuScreen and GameScreen and the game logic

Re-do menu screen when paused

Menu is being redrawn each cycle due to render() in main loop when the 3rd button is pressed...

follow guide here

Use MainMenu.java as temporary sandbox

3-10-2015
Code the logic in button listeners in MainMenu.java (and ditch MainMenuScreen.java, or rename)

Why does the game not resume after hitting 'play' in menu?
Probably because something isn't being set up right when we switch screens
MainMenu -> GameScreen

setInputProcessor isn't being called on screen switches... is this a problem?

Look at the code example from
Development/gdx-ui-app
for screen transitions

Figured it out by just creating a new MainMenu

Render runs 60 times / sec, so the time between each render is about 16.666 ms.
Global speed decays at 95% each frame.
Global speed bonus decays at -1 each frame. But the displayed global speed bonus is x100.

To figure out the distance traveled after shutdown, take the time elapsed, then apply the decay for that duration of time.

Do a simple popup that says "x seconds (minutes/hours/days) elapsed since your last playing. You've traveled y distance"

5-7-2015
Implement a function that takes in time and calculates distance. Should be constant time.

5-9-2015
Go with linear decay of speed = bonus.
Todo: Add special cases for:
    1) when bonus speed expires before time elapsed
    2) when time elapsed is less than bonus time (currently working)
    3) when reaching end of stage

Figure out why the screen flickers
